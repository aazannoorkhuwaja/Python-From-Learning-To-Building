# Python: From Learning to Building 🐍

Welcome to my Python repository! This space serves as a central hub for my transition from language fundamentals to building complex, real-world logic. As a **Computer Science Student @ FAST**, I am using this repository to document my growth in backend-readiness and algorithmic thinking.

My primary goal is to master **Problem Solving**. I believe that code is just a tool; the real skill lies in the logic. This repo tracks my journey of scaling from simple scripts to scalable backend architectures.

## 🛠️ Tech & Tools
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Environment:** Linux (Ubuntu)
- **Focus Areas:** Logic Building, Backend Engineering, Automation.

## 📈 Learning Roadmap
- [x] Basic Syntax & Control Flow
- [x] Data Structures (Lists, Dicts, Sets)
- [ ] Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- [ ] Scaling Logic via LeetCode
- [ ] Connecting Python to SQL Databases
